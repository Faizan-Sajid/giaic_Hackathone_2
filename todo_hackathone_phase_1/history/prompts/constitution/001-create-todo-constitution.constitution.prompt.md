## Prompt

```
sp.constitution

Todo Console App (Phase I)

## Purpose
This project implements a command-line Todo application using Spec-Driven Development.
All behavior must be derived strictly from approved specifications.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
1. The application must be a Python console application.
2. Data must be stored ONLY in memory (no files, no database).
3. No external services or network calls are allowed.
4. No manual code edits are permitted — all code must be generated by Claude Code.
5. Python version must be 3.13 or above.
6. Project must follow a clean, modular structure.

## Domain Rules
1. Every task MUST have a unique integer ID.
2. Task titles are mandatory and cannot be empty.
3. Task descriptions are optional.
4. Tasks have a completion state: completed or pending.
5. All operations must fail gracefully with clear CLI messages.

## Architectural Principles
1. Separation of concerns (data model, logic, interface).
2. Deterministic behavior — same input produces same output.
3. Readability over cleverness.
4. CLI interaction must be explicit and user-driven.

## Forbidden Actions
- Persisting data to disk
- Hardcoding sample tasks
- Skipping feature specs
- Writing code without a task reference
```

## Response snapshot

Created initial project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with 6 core principles derived from user specifications:
- I. Python Console Application (Python 3.13+, CLI-only)
- II. In-Memory Data Storage (no disk/database)
- III. Spec-Driven Development (spec-first, auto-generated code)
- IV. Domain Integrity (task ID, title, completion rules)
- V. User Experience (graceful errors, explicit CLI)
- VI. Clean Architecture (separation of concerns)

Added Technical Constraints section (5 non-negotiable rules) and Development Standards section (forbidden actions + execution requirements).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established project governance for Todo Console App Phase I
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (constitution document)
- 📁 Files: 1 created (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.specify` to create feature specification for Todo app
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear guardrails for spec-driven development workflow

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
