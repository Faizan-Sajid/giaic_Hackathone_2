# Todo Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Python Console Application
The application MUST be a Python console application running version 3.13 or above.
All interaction occurs via command-line interface with explicit user-driven commands.
No graphical user interface or web-based frontend is permitted.

Rationale: Python provides a clean, portable foundation for command-line tools.
Version 3.13 ensures access to modern language features and performance improvements.

### II. In-Memory Data Storage
All application data MUST be stored exclusively in memory.
No files, databases, or external storage mechanisms are permitted.
Data persists only for the duration of a single process execution.

Rationale: Eliminates complexity of file handling and database connections.
Enforces simplicity and aligns with the spec-driven, ephemeral nature of Phase I.

### III. Spec-Driven Development
All behavior MUST be derived strictly from approved specifications.
No manual code edits are permitted — all code MUST be generated by Claude Code.
Code changes must reference specific tasks or specification requirements.

Rationale: Ensures alignment between implementation and documented requirements.
Automated code generation eliminates drift and ensures consistency.

### IV. Domain Integrity
Every task MUST have a unique integer ID assigned automatically.
Task titles are mandatory and cannot be empty or whitespace-only.
Task descriptions are optional and may be empty.
Tasks have a binary completion state: completed or pending (default).
Duplicate IDs MUST NOT exist; ID generation must be deterministic.

Rationale: These rules form the fundamental contract of the task model.
Deterministic behavior ensures predictable CLI interactions.

### V. User Experience
All operations MUST fail gracefully with clear, actionable error messages.
CLI interaction MUST be explicit and user-driven — no implicit actions.
Input validation MUST occur before any state mutation.

Rationale: Users must understand what happened and why when errors occur.
Explicit interactions prevent accidental data loss or unexpected behavior.

### VI. Clean Architecture
The codebase MUST follow separation of concerns: data model, business logic, and CLI interface.
Code MUST be modular with clear boundaries between layers.
Readability takes precedence over clever optimizations.

Rationale: Maintainable codebases require clear structural organization.
Separation enables independent testing and future extensibility.

## Technical Constraints

The following constraints are non-negotiable and apply to all implementation work:

1. **Language**: Python 3.13 or above, console application only
2. **Storage**: In-memory data structures only (no files, no database)
3. **Network**: No external services or network calls permitted
4. **Code Generation**: All code must be generated by Claude Code (no manual edits)
5. **Structure**: Clean, modular architecture with separation of concerns

## Development Standards

### Forbidden Actions
- Persisting data to disk in any form
- Hardcoding sample tasks or demonstration data
- Skipping feature specifications or task references
- Writing code without a corresponding task ID

### Execution Requirements
- Every code change must reference a specific task
- All behavior must trace back to approved specifications
- Tests should be written for independently testable units
- Commits should reflect logical units of work

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices for this project.
Amendments require documentation of rationale and impact assessment.
All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
For runtime development guidance, refer to project specifications and task definitions.
